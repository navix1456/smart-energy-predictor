# Smart Energy Forecasting Pipeline â€“ Project Plan

## Overview
Design and implement a complete ML production pipeline to predict smart home electricity consumption using time-series and environmental features. Built with Scikit-learn, MLflow, FastAPI, and deployed with Docker + CI/CD, enabling real-time predictions for smart energy-saving systems.

## Step-by-Step Plan

- [x] **Define Project Requirements and Success Criteria**
- [x] **Design Pipeline Architecture**
- [x] **Set Up Project Structure and Version Control**
- [x] **Implement Data Ingestion and Preprocessing**
- [x] **Develop and Train ML Model**
- [x] **Evaluate Model Performance**
- [x] **Build FastAPI Service for Real-Time Predictions**
- [x] **Containerize Application with Docker**
- [x] **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline for Automated Testing**
- [ ] **Cloud Deployment (AWS, etc.)** *(future/optional step)*
- [x] **Test the End-to-End Pipeline and Validate Real-Time Prediction Functionality**

---

**Next Steps (Optional):**
- Deploy to cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
- Add advanced features (authentication, monitoring, etc.)
- Experiment with more models or larger datasets

We have completed all local, Docker, and CI/CD steps. Cloud deployment can be done in the future as needed.
