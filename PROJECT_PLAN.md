# Smart Energy Forecasting Pipeline â€“ Project Plan

## Overview
Design and implement a complete ML production pipeline to predict smart home electricity consumption using time-series and environmental features. Built with Scikit-learn, MLflow, FastAPI, and deployed with Docker + CI/CD on AWS Cloud, enabling real-time predictions for smart energy-saving systems.

## Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Define Project Requirements and Success Criteria**
   - Clarify objectives, data sources, and performance goals.
   - Identify stakeholders and use cases.

2. **Design Pipeline Architecture**
   - Plan data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment stages.
   - Choose tools and frameworks for each stage.

3. **Set Up Project Structure and Version Control**
   - Organize codebase directories.
   - Initialize Git repository.

4. **Implement Data Ingestion and Preprocessing**
   - Load and clean time-series and environmental data.
   - Feature engineering and transformation.

5. **Develop and Train ML Model**
   - Use Scikit-learn for model development.
   - Track experiments and parameters with MLflow.

6. **Evaluate Model Performance**
   - Assess accuracy and robustness.
   - Select the best model for deployment.

7. **Build FastAPI Service for Real-Time Predictions**
   - Create REST API endpoints for prediction.
   - Integrate model into the API.

8. **Containerize Application with Docker**
   - Write Dockerfile and requirements.
   - Ensure reproducible builds.

9. **Set Up CI/CD for AWS Deployment**
   - Automate testing and deployment pipeline.
   - Configure AWS services for hosting.

10. **Test End-to-End Pipeline**
    - Validate real-time prediction functionality.
    - Monitor and document system performance.
