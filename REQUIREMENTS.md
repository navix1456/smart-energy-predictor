# Project Requirements – Smart Energy Forecasting Pipeline

## Objective
Predict smart home electricity consumption using historical usage and environmental features.

## Data Source
- Use a public dataset, such as the UCI “Individual household electric power consumption” dataset.

## Features
- Time-series features: past electricity usage, time of day, day of week
- Environmental features: temperature, humidity (if available; otherwise, focus on time-based features)

## Prediction Frequency
- Hourly predictions

## Expected Output
- Predicted electricity consumption for the next hour

## Performance Goal
- Achieve reasonable accuracy (e.g., RMSE as low as possible for a first model)

## Stakeholders / Use Case
- Demonstration for learning purposes
- Could be extended for smart home automation or energy-saving recommendations
